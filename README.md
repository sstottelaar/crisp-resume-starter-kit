## Demo

I've build my own resume with Crisp (of course), which you can preview at <a href="https://resume.sjoerdstottelaar.nl" target="_blank">https://resume.sjoerdstottelaar.nl</a>.

## Installation

To install Crisp simply follow the [installing a starter kit guide](https://statamic.dev/starter-kits/installing-a-starter-kit]).

Using the Statamic CLI tool run the following command:
`statamic new mysite sstottelaar/crisp-resume-starter-kit`

> üå∂Ô∏è take: I recommend only installing it into a new fresh installation.
